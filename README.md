        CHILD MONITORING SYSTEM             
______________________________________________
OVERVIEW
Depression is a serious mental illness and can affect children as young as 6 years old. 
Depression is already a difficult mental illness to detect but in children it can prove 
to be even harder as children often have difficulty communicating their feelings.
The Purpose of this project is to design a system that makes it easier for Parent, guardian
and psychologist to monitor a child behaviour.
